## My name is **Kevin Haller** and I'm a **Project Employee** at TU Wien specializing in **Exploratory Search on Knowledge Graphs**

I work as project asssistant at TU Wien, where enabling exploratory search on knowledge graphs is the main focus of my work (as part of the EU project called OntoTrans). In this job, I gained deeper experience about Semantic Web technologies and graph databases.

I am currently enrolled in the master programme ‘Software Engineering and Internet Computing’ at TU Wien and expect to graduate from this programme in April 2023.

My interests are mainly in the construction of knowledge graphs, application of graph analysis such as similarity metrics or knowledge graph embeddings, and the efficient search in knowledge graphs.
