## My name is **Kevin Haller** and I'm a **Project Assistant** at TU Wien specializing in **Exploratory Search on Knowledge Graphs**

...

I am currently enrolled in the master programme ‘Software Engineering and
Internet Computing’ at TU Wien and expect to graduate from this programme in
April 2023.

My interests are mainly in the construction of knowledge graphs, and the
application of graph algorithms for KG‑based recommendation engines.
