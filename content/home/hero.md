## My name is **Kevin Haller** and I'm a **Project Assistant** at TU Wien specializing in **Exploratory Search on Knowledge Graphs**

I work as project asssistant at TU Wien, where enabling exploratory search on 
knowledge graphs is the main focus of my work. In this job, I gained deeper
experience about Semantic Web technologies and graph databases.

I am currently enrolled in the master programme ‘Software Engineering and
Internet Computing’ at TU Wien and expect to graduate from this programme in
April 2023.

My interests are mainly in the construction of knowledge graphs, application of
graph analysis such as similarity metrics or knowledge graph embeddings, and the
efficient search in knowledge graphs.
