## My name is **Kevin Haller** and I'm a **Senior Backend Developer** at deepsearch

At deepsearch, I contribute to the design and implementation of components in a semantic AI platform.

I am currently enrolled in the master programme ‘Software Engineering and
Internet Computing’ at TU Wien and expect to graduate from this programme in 2023.

My interests are mainly in the construction and application of knowledge graphs.
